# Pilgrim_Booking_Application-using-MYSQL
Designed a booking application that allows users to visualize the availability of rooms and airline tickets in multiple cities. We mapped tables from source to destination, ETL by loading CSV files into MYSQL database and designed the final table along with views in normalized form. Generated reports with Power BI based on staging data.
